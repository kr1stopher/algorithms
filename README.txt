Summary of various Algorithms in this directory 

uniqueStirngs.cpp
	(1) determine if a string is unique without an extra data structure O(n^2) 
	(2) determine if a string is unique using an extra data structure O(n)
	(3) Reverse a string O(n) 
	(4) isPermutation: checks to see if str2 is a permutation of string1 (allowing for str2 to be a substring of str1)
	(5)Checks to see if str1 and str2 are permutations of one another 
	(6) replaceSpace: replaces spaces in a string with %20
	(7) charCount: returns char count of each char as a string 
	(8) compressed string: compresses a string based on its charaters
	(9) Write an algorithm such that if an element in an MxN matrix is 0, its entire row and column are set to 0
	
linkedlistAlgs.cpp
	(1) node1 and updated node class for linked list operation 
	(2) write a function to remove duplicates from linked list
	(3) return the kth to last element of a linked list 
	(4) given a node and only a node, remove it from the list 
	(5)You have two numbers represented by a linked list, where each node contains a single digit. The digits are stored in reverse order, such that the Ts digit is at the head of the list. Write a function that adds the two numbers and returns the sum
